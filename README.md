# Sample Snack app

During setup, I was so confused only because I knew so little about the coding language but through experimentation I got the hang of it. I started out with identifying the use and function of almost evey line to discern what I should and shouldn't keep, then adjusting the project accordingly. I found out that the 'Card' component is a fancy word for "border" because that's essentially all it does. I added it to my project because I thought it looked nicer.
